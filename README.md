- Technologies used : Angular, Bootstrap, JSON API : OpenWeatherMap
- Functionalities implemented : 

          - Search by entering the city name or geographic coordinates
          - The results include the current weather in the metric or imperial system as a user's choice, as well as the forecast for up to 5 days ahead
